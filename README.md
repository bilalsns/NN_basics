# NN_basics

This repository encapsulates my hands-on journey through Sentdex's [Neural Networks from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3) YouTube series. The course delves into building neural networks from the ground up using pure Python, without relying on external libraries. It offers a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental components and mechanics of neural networks.

## 📚 Course Overview

The first eight lessons of the series cover the following topics:

1. **Intro and Neuron Code**  
   Implementing a single neuron with multiple inputs and a bias.

2. **Coding a Layer**  
   Building a layer of neurons to process multiple inputs simultaneously.

3. **The Dot Product**  
   Understanding and applying the dot product to efficiently compute neuron outputs.

4. **Batches, Layers, and Objects**  
   Introducing batch processing and structuring code using object-oriented programming principles.

5. **Hidden Layer Activation Functions**  
   Exploring activation functions like ReLU to introduce non-linearity into the network.

6. **Softmax Activation**  
   Implementing the Softmax function to convert outputs into probability distributions for classification tasks.

7. **Calculating Loss with Categorical Cross-Entropy**  
   Measuring the performance of the classification model using the categorical cross-entropy loss function.

8. **Implementing Loss**  
   Integrating the loss function into the network to evaluate and guide the training process.
